# tractor-wiring
There are many wiring diagrams for various vintage tractors floating around the internet, but many were designed by users on the various forums and are preserved as low-res JPEGS. In order to better preserve these schematics for the future generations to make use of, I am converting them into schematics generated in diagrams.net (formerly draw.io). 

In addition to this, I am also exporting them as PDFs and SVGs so there is a diverse base of sources to rebuilt from should anything happen to diagrams.net in the future.
